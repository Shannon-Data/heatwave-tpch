# HeatWave TPC-H

MySQL HeatWave is a fully managed and highly scalable in-memory database service which provides a cost-efficient solution for 
OLTP, OLAP and Machine Learning. It is available on both Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Amazon Web Service (AWS).

HeatWave is tightly integrated with MySQL database and is optimized for underlying infrastructure.
You can run analytics on your MySQL data without requiring ETL and without any change to Your applications. Your 
applications connect to the HeatWave cluster through standard MySQL protocols.
The MySQL Database is built on the MySQL Enterprise Edition Server, which allows developers to quickly create and deploy secure 
cloud native applications using the world's most popular open source database. 

This repository contains SQL scripts derived from [TPC Benchmark&trade;H (TPC-H)][1]. The SQL scripts contain TPC-H schema
generation statements and queries derived from TPC-H benchmark, specific for MySQL HeatWave

## Software prerequisites:
1. [TPC-H data generation tool][2] to generate TPC-H dataset for workload sizes of your choice
2. [MySQL Shell][3] to import generated TPC-H dataset to MySQL HeatWave

## Required services:
1. [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][7]
2. [MySQL HeatWave on OCI][4] or [MySQL HeatWave on AWS]

## Repository
* [TPCH](TPCH) - a collection of scripts for TPC-H schema and queries specific to MySQL Database Service
* [HeatWave](HeatWave) - a collection of scripts to configure HeatWave to run TPC-H queries

## Getting started
To run TPC-H queries in HeatWave
1. Generate TPC-H data using TPC-H data generation tool
2. Provision MySQL Database System
3. Run [create_tables.sql](TPCH/create_tables.sql) to create TPC-H schema on MySQL Database Service instance
4. Import TPC-H data generated to MySQL Database System. See [MySQL Shell Parallel Table Import Utility documentation][6]
5. Add a HeatWave cluster to MySQL Database System. See [HeatWave][5] documentation
6. Run [secondary_load.sql](HeatWave/secondary_load.sql) to configure and load data to HeatWave cluster
7. You are now ready to run the queries derived from TPC-H
